# CSanim

This is a little animation library that I wrote for my Computer Science blog [InfoGenius](https://github.com/Gareth618/infogenius).

It's based on [P5.JS](https://p5js.org/), and inspired by 3Blue1Brown's [Manim](https://github.com/3b1b/manim).

**Demo:** [click here](https://zen-bardeen-e5e882.netlify.app/)
